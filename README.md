A chatbot implemented in TensorFlow based on the sequence to sequence model, with certain rules integrated.

Working on a new version that will be based on the new NMT model (Dynamic RNN based). Stay tuned.

Check the Legacy_Chatbot branch (https://github.com/bshao001/ChatLearner/tree/Legacy_Chatbot) if you are interested in the legacy seq2seq model implementation.
