"""Library for creating sequence-to-sequence models in TensorFlow.

Sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural networks can learn complex functions
that map input sequences to output sequences. These models yield very good
results on a number of tasks, such as speech recognition, parsing, machine
translation, or even constructing automated replies to emails.

Before using this module, it is recommended to read the TensorFlow tutorial
on sequence-to-sequence models. It explains the basic concepts of this module
and shows an end-to-end example of how to build a translation model.
  https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/tutorials/seq2seq/index.html

Here is an overview of functions available in this module. They all use
a very similar interface, so after reading the above tutorial and using
one of them, others should be easy to substitute.

* Full sequence-to-sequence models.
  - basic_rnn_seq2seq: The most basic RNN-RNN model.
  - tied_rnn_seq2seq: The basic model with tied encoder and decoder weights.
  - embedding_rnn_seq2seq: The basic model with input embedding.
  - embedding_tied_rnn_seq2seq: The tied model with input embedding.
  - embedding_attention_seq2seq: Advanced model with input embedding and
      the neural attention mechanism; recommended for complex tasks.

* Multi-task sequence-to-sequence models.
  - one2many_rnn_seq2seq: The embedding model with multiple decoders.

* Decoders (when you write your own encoder, you can use these to decode;
    e.g., if you want to write a model that generates captions for images).
  - rnn_decoder: The basic decoder based on a pure RNN.
  - attention_decoder: A decoder that uses the attention mechanism.

* Losses.
  - sequence_loss: Loss for a sequence model returning average log-perplexity.
  - sequence_loss_by_example: As above, but not averaging over all examples.

* model_with_buckets: A convenience function to create models with bucketing
    (see the tutorial above for an explanation of why and how to use it).

      inputs will be taken from previous outputs (as in embedding_rnn_decoder).
