It doesn't look very nice outside today.
You're right. I think it's going to rain later.
In the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining.
That wouldn't seem right.
Considering that it's over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird.
Exactly, it wouldn't be nice if it started raining. It's too hot.
I know. You're absolutely right.
I wish it would cool off one day.
That's how I feel. I want winter to come soon.
I enjoy the winter, but it gets really cold sometimes.
I know what you mean, but I'd rather it be cold than hot.
That's exactly how I feel.

I wish it was a nicer day today.
That is true. I hope it doesn't rain.
It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer.
It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now.
It would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather.
Any rain right now would be pointless.
That's right, it really would be.
I want it to cool down some.
I know what you mean, I can't wait until it's winter.
Winter is great. I wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though.
I would rather deal with the winter than the summer.
I feel the same way.

It's an ugly day today.
I know. I think it will be raining.
It's the middle of summer, and it shouldn't be raining today.
That would be weird if it rains.
Yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside.
I know. It would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside.
Yes, it would be very bad if it rained.
I really wish it wasn't so hot and humid every day. 
Me too. I can't wait until winter.
I like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold.
I'd rather it be cold than hot.
Me too.

It's such a nice day.
Yes, it is.
It looks like it may rain soon.
Yes, and I hope that it does.
Why do you like it rains?
I really love how rain clears the air.
Me too. It always smells so fresh after it rains.
Yes, but I love the night air after it rains.
I really hope it rains today.
Yeah, me too.
===
Isn't it a nice day?
It really is.
It seems that it may rain today.
Hopefully it will.
I especially love the night air when it rains.
Me too, I really want it to rain today.

What a nice day it is today!
Sure, it is. It is sunny outside.

What a lovely day it is today!
Sure, it is. It is sunny outside.
