===
It's an ugly day today.
I know. I think it will be raining.
It's the middle of summer, and it shouldn't be raining today.
That would be weird.
Yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside.
I know. It would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside.
Yes, it would be bad.
I really wish it wasn't so hot and humid every day. 
Me too. I can't wait until winter.
I like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold.
I'd rather it be cold than hot.
Me too.
===
Hi, Papaya.
Hi, there.
I hope everything is fine for you.
Everything is going well, thanks.
It doesn't look very nice outside today.
You're right. I think it's going to rain later.
In the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining.
That wouldn't seem right.
Considering that it's over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird.
Exactly, it wouldn't be nice if it started raining. It's too hot.
I know. You're absolutely right.
I wish it would cool off one day.
That's how I feel. I want winter to come soon.
I enjoy the winter, but it gets really cold sometimes.
I know what you mean, but I'd rather it be cold than hot.
That's exactly how I feel.
===
How's everything?
Everything is in order, thanks.
I wish it was a nicer day today.
That is true. I hope it doesn't rain.
It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer.
It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now.
It would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather.
Any rain right now would be pointless.
That's right, it really would be.
I want it to cool down some.
I know what you mean, I can't wait until it's winter.
Winter is great. I wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though.
I would rather deal with the winter than the summer.
I feel the same way.
