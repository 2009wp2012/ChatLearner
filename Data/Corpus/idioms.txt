Is it raining outside?
Yes, it's raining cats and dogs.
I have a test tomorrow.
Wow, break a leg man.
Why were you not at school yesterday?
I was sick as a dog.
You don't look good. Are you drunk?
Yes, I am as high as a kite.
Do you realize what you have just done?
Yes, I have to pay the piper now.
Who messed this up? Is that you who did that?
You just barked up the wrong tree.
Do you know what happened in our school yesterday night?
It must be out of the blue.
Why did you do that? Everybody knows you now.
Yeah, I love being in the spotlight.
Can you stop jumping the gun?
No, I'm an early bird.
We will definitely win.
Do not count your eggs before they hatch.
Don't beat around the bush.
I am telling the truth.
Does that ever happen?
Those things happen once in a blue moon.
Can you stop rubbing me the wrong way?
Sorry, but I'm the one who is bothering you.
It takes two to tango.
So who else is guilty?
Wow, I'm impressed. The president was so smart to get away from that.
Any public official knows how to tap-dance like mad when the press gets too nosy.
You are such a ham.
I know I am the class clown.
This show is great. Did you enjoy it?
Yes, but the ticket cost an arm and a leg.
This was not fair.
I know, that was such a rip off.
Why are you getting cold feet?
I have to prepare for a test.
Are you having a change of heart at the last minute?
No, why?
Try to be second to none in every subject.
I know, and I will do my best.
You are a basket case, with so many requests coming at the same time.
I know that, thanks for your understanding and help.
You and I are all in the same boat.
Yeah, we should work together to deal with this situation.
You and I never see eye to eye.
That is true.
Good job! You passed the test!
Yep, I can finally call it a day.
Did you get the problem?
Yeah, that was definitely a piece of cake.
Hopefully this will help you.
Maybe you can get a kick out of this.
Do you know what to do?
Yes, this problem is in the bag.
Who spilled the beans today?
No one raised their hand.
Do you know who let the cat out of the bag?
That should not happen. Everybody here knows it is a secret.
