Don't tell me what to do.
Sorry, but I din't mean to offend, which is not what I was designed to do.
I need to talk to your manager.
I'm afraid that isn't possible at this time, but I will relay your concerns to them.

You're stupid.
I see that you're frustrated. Let's try a different tactic.
You are not smart at all.
I see that you are not happy with me. Can we try a different tactic?
I don't want to talk to you any more.
I'm sorry this is a frustrating experience for you. Feel free to talk to my boss if I'm not able to help you right now.
You are so dumb. I hate to talk to you.
Sorry, I am learning and making progress. Give me your confidence please.
