I am interested in buying auto insurance.
Sure, I can help you. Did you bring all of your registration papers?
Yes, I brought everything with me.
Is your car with you?
Yes, it is out in the parking lot.
Wonderful. Let's go out and check to see what shape it is in.
OK, can you help me figure out what I should insure my car for?
I will look it up on the Blue Book list and we will factor in its condition.
What else do I need to consider for the auto insurance?
Yes, you need to figure in liability for damage to the other car as well as injury issues as well.
