Are you going to the party on Saturday?
I was thinking about it. Are you?
Yeah, I heard it's going to be a lot of fun.
Really? Well, what time will it start?
It will start at 8:00 pm, and I really think you should go.
Well, who else are going to be there?
Everybody from school.
How do you know it's going to be so fun?
This party is going to have a DJ, food, and drinks.
Wow, that does sound like it's going to be fun.
So am I going to see you at the party?
Yeah, I will be there.

What will you be doing this weekend?
I am not sure. What are you doing?
I was thinking of maybe taking a drive to the beach.
That sounds like a great idea!
Would you be interested in joining me?
Sure, I would love to go with you. When would you be leaving?
I thought that we could leave around 8:00 in the morning.
That would give us plenty of time to explore. Did you know that there is a music festival on the beach in Santa Barbara?
That was part of my plan.
Well then, I'll see you on Saturday. Thanks for inviting me to go with you.

I can't figure out what to get Mary for her birthday.
I am having a problem figuring that out myself. It's kind of challenging, uhh? Do you want to pick something out together?
Yes, that way we would have more money to spend.
She has a lot of interests. What things do you think she likes to do the best?
Well, she really likes going hiking, listening to music, and travel.
The music idea sounds good. I wonder who knows what concerts she might like to go to?
Maybe we could ask her roommate, Maria, who her favorite groups are.
Maria would be a great help. She has known Mary for a long time.
Let's e-mail Maria and ask her for her suggestions.
I think that maybe Maria might like to contribute to this gift too.
