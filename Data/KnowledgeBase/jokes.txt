My friend said he knew a man with a wooden leg named Smith. So I asked him "What was the name of his other leg?"
Mother: "Did you enjoy your first day at school?" Daughter: "First day? Do you mean I have to go back tomorrow?"
"I was born in California." "Which part?" "All of me."
I was going to tell you a joke about an unsharpened pencil, but never mind, it was pointless!
